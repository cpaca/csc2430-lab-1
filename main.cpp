/*
 * Before running the program take a look at the following two pages:
 * --> getline:    http://cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/getline/
 * --> operator>>: http://cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/operator%3E%3E/
 *
 * 1. When does the getline function stop reading from the input stream?
 * getline() stops reading after it finds a new line, specifically "\n"
 * 2. When does the operator>> stop reading from the input stream?
 * It stops when it finds any whitespace. This typically means spaces or newlines
 * but given that it says "whitespace" I assume the zero-width space â€‹ counts too.
 * Huh. Apparantly CLion actually renders the zero width space as "ZWSP". Neat!

     * --> 3. Any idea why the output is shown in a different color?
     * It was sent to cerr instead of cout. While cout uses white outputs, cerr uses red outputs.
     * Presumably, cerr uses red outputs so you can see that it's red.

     * data.txt
     * 4. Was it able to open it? Any idea why?
     * No. I'd guess maybe because it's running in this file (main.cpp) or inside the cmake-build-debug file.
     * Put another way, [dir]/main.cpp/data.txt doesn't exist.
     *
     * ../data.txt
     * This time the program must've been able to open the file
     * 5. Why do you think that is? A hint: where is the program running from?
     * It probably worked this time because [dir]/main.cpp/.. = [dir].
